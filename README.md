# Automation-Hub

Welcome to **Automation-Hub**, a centralized repository for DevOps automation scripts, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and related documentation. This project aims to streamline and organize automation workflows for DevOps practices.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a hub for:

- Storing and managing automation scripts (e.g., Bash, Python).
- Defining CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Maintaining infrastructure code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
- Documenting DevOps processes and workflows.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirmsut/Automation-Hub.git
   cd Automation-Hub
   ```

2. **Explore the Folders**:

   - Check `docs/` for setup instructions and workflow guides.
   - Use `scripts/` for executable automation scripts.
   - Review `pipelines/` for CI/CD configurations.
   - Modify `terraform/` or `ansible/` for infrastructure changes.

3. **Add Your Contributions**:
   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
   - Add files or update existing ones.
   - Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`.
   - Push and create a pull request: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.

## Usage

- **Scripts**: Run scripts in `scripts/` for tasks like deployment or monitoring. Example:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/deploy.sh
  ```
- **Pipelines**: Use `pipelines/` to set up CI/CD in your preferred platform.
- **IaC**: Apply Terraform or Ansible configurations for infrastructure provisioning.
- **Docs**: Refer to `docs/` for detailed guides on workflows and processes.
